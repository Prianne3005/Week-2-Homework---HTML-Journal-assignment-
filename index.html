    <h1>My College Experience and Aspirations</h1>

    <p>
        As a <strong>Communication Design major</strong>, college has been an inspiring space where I get to blend creativity with meaningful messages. Every project I take on challenges me to think deeper about visual storytelling and its impact on real people.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my free time, I love to <em>hang out with friends</em>. Whether it’s grabbing food, exploring the city, or just relaxing and talking, being around people I care about helps me recharge. 
        After graduation, I hope to work in a creative agency or as a freelance designer, helping brands express their identity with purpose and style.

    <p>
        One ethical value I really believe in is empathy — being able to see things from someone else’s perspective is at the heart of good design and good relationships. <br>
        Also, my favorite food? Definitely pasta — there’s just something comforting and satisfying about it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Something I want people to know about me is that I’m passionate about creating visuals that not only look good but also make people feel something. That’s what great design is all about.
